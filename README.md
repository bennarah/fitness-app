# fitness-app

Agile-based mobile fitness application designed to help users achieve both fitness and overall health goals through personalized, AI-powered insights.

## Overview
This project is a team-based mobile fitness application focused on supporting users in building sustainable workout routines while tracking progress toward personalized health goals. The app emphasizes usability, adaptability, and data-driven recommendations to enhance the fitness experience.

## Problem Statement
Many fitness applications focus solely on workouts without addressing broader health goals or adapting to individual user needs. This project aimed to bridge that gap by combining fitness planning with personalized health insights.

## Key Features
- Personalized workout planning and tracking
- Health and fitness goal setting
- AI-assisted insights and recommendations
